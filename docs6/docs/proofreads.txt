----------------------------------------------------------------
ALL:
* csv to csv,tsv throughout
* rid of explicitly passing around os.Stdout in all various help functions, annoying
* het.dkvp > het.json in more places
* check each page for adequate h2 coverage
* hash-map / hashmap -> map everywhere

----------------------------------------------------------------
E flatten/unflatten page: make one! :)
E memory/streaming page
E flesh out data-types page!
E flesh out arrays page!
E new maps page!
  - insertion order ...
  - for-k-v etc

c GOMAXPROCS -- up it? separate page maybe -- ?
  - note one goroutine for in, out, & each verb
  - check and respect env-var

e docs6/rmd: big picture .md.in -> .md -> build -> isp/rtd; or live
? somewhere, do-it-all sequencing:
  o go build
  o go test
  o make in man6
  o regen.sh in docs6

? why are purple.csv.cg red.csv.gz yellow.csv.gz changing on regens?
----------------------------------------------------------------

index:
E CSV -> CSV/TSV

features:
E CSV -> CSV/TSV

feature-comparison:
E even with newlines -- show an example

file-formats:
w tabularize by concatenating keys: update
  o JSON-to-JSON
  o JSON-to-not
  o not-to-JSON
  o not-to-not
l arrays linkify
? Formatting JSON Options: check each flag is still current
? Data-conversion keystroke-savers: to/from separate page. and/or merge.
? autodetect: hmmmmmmmm

record-heterogeneity:
? current csv-reader code handles this? i think not. check csvlite-reader too.

new-in-miller-6:
w flatten/unflatten -- needs a new separate page
? TODO marks
* ?? and ??= operators
  - link to BNF for operator-precedence table (wherever that is) as well

csv-with-and-without-headers:
? Headerless CSV with duplicate field values -> typo-fix -- duplicate keys actually -- ?!?
? cat out nas.csv first
? ag -> just grep ?
l Miller handles compliant CSV: include rfc4180 link
? Regularizing ragged CSV: use regularize verb?!?

shapes-of-data:
? autodetect -- remove?
E data/small -> example.csv (and throughout ...)
E Rectangularizing data: cf regularize verb, & other page?

special-symbols-and-formatting:
? mlr --icsv --odkvp --ofs '\001'  cat commas.csv | cat -v
  o test this
  o look for unbackslash callsites in the C impl
  o SeparatorFromArg
? How to escape '?' in regexes? -> still true? link to torbiak297?

operating-on-all-records:
o linkify map/array/etc
o 1-up link at end
o insord link at end
o int2str@key link at end

dates-and-times:
? Caveat: localtime-handling in timezones with DST is still a work in progress -- fixed by torbiak?

shell-commands:
e while-read example from issues

log-processing-examples:
l or Miller's having-fields, or is_present -> DSL is_present, & linkify
? grep 'various sorts' *.log \
  | sed 's/.*} //' \
  | mlr --fs space --repifs --oxtab stats1 -a min,p10,p50,p90,max -f time -g status -- why no output?

sql-examples:
l Again, all the examples in the CSV section apply here -- linkify "CSV section"

data-cleaning-examples:
? mlr --icsv --opprint put '$format_ok = is_string($reachable)' data/het-bool.csv -- do false/true autotype -- ?

statistics-examples:
? 2nd card no output b/c stats1 --fr

two-pass-algorithms:
l link to "new" verbs x everywhere possible
l Of course, Miller verbs such as sort, tac, etc. all must ... -> linkify to new memory/streaming page
x this (or wherever ...) maybe get rid of some of the too-many examples. pick some survivors; x the rest.

misc examples:
? Program timing & subsequents -> another page

reference-verbs:
E mlr --opprint bar --auto -f x,y data/small -> use some int data to avoid line-wraps
E data/colored-shapes.dkvp (this page & throughout) a CSV file ...
* ... I ONLY READ UP TO CUT & PAUSED ...

reference-main-auxiliary-commands:
c mlr lecat -> have the code use colors stuff not hard-coded -- ? patch into env vars -- ? code: check isatty.

reference-main-data-types:
E field values are usually strings -> update
E Field values are treated as numeric for the following: -> update
? Miller's types for function processing are -> add JSON null; & check for others (array/map)
E true/false -> add info about NaN and Inf et al.
!! very much missing stuff!! where's the listing of mlrval types?!?
  - reference-dsl-variables.md.in should link to it
  - ditto programming-language.md.in
c UTs for r"a" . r"b" and so on and so on

reference-main-null-data:
? more variants of is_... ?
? Records with one or more empty sort-field values sort after records with all sort-field values present -> apparently not true for sort -nr

reference-main-arithmetic:
? remove references to put/filter -F
? test stats1/step -F flag
? The following, however, produce integer output if their inputs are integers: + - * / // % abs ceil floor max min round roundm sgn. As well, stats1 -a min, stats1 -a max, stats1 -a sum, step -a delta, and step -a rsum produce integer output if their inputs are integers. -> test all

reference-main-regular-expressions:
? regular expressions (of type POSIX.2) -> check/update; also link to Go page
d separate escaping for "\t" etc in arg-2/regex position -- "\t"."\t" example as well ...

reference-main-overview:
E is that it is designed for -> write and link to streaming-operations page

reference-dsl-operators:
c Operator precedence: add >>>; check for other new operators (like ??)
c code: ** operator have int-int-to-int check?

reference-dsl-control-structures:
E emph p-a blocks are syntactic sugar for if-statements
? mlr put '$x > 0.0; $y = log10($x); $z = sqrt($y)' data/put-gating-example-1.dkvp -> no longer true -- wtf? is this doc-snippet non-live?
e while (NR < 10) will never terminate as NR is only incremented between records -> and each expression is invoked once per record so once for NR=1, once for NR=2, etc.
E C-style triple-for loops: loop to NR -> NO!!!
? or if a same-name variable is present in outer scope then it is modified. -> check that and make sure there is a UT
l Since uninitialized out-of-stream variables default to 0 for addition/substraction and 1 for multiplication when they appear on expression right-hand sides (not quite as in awk, where they'd default to 0 either way) <-> xlink to other page

reference-dsl-user-defined-functions:
E User-defined subroutines -> non-factorial example -- maybe some useful aggregator

reference-dsl-builtin-functions:
c mlr: option "--list-all-functions-as-table" not recognized. Please run "mlr --help" for usage information -> fix
! ... need to proofread entire list ...

reference-dsl-output-statements:
? NR %% 1000 == 0 -> why %%
E Keep in mind that out-of-stream variables are a nested, multi-level hashmap (directly viewable as JSON using dump), whereas Miller output records are lists of single-level key-value pairs -> link to flatten page
? Use --oflatsep -> check
? mlr --oxtab put -q --oflatsep / '
  o 2 examples not 3?
  o why not '--oflatsep /' respected?

reference-dsl-differences.md:
l check for linkify opportunities
